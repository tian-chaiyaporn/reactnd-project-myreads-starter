# MyReads Project

This is a project completed from a starter file for the purpose of learning the React Framework at Udacity.com. The app allows you to search a book and add it to one of the three categories: 'Currently Reading', 'Want to Read', and 'Read'. The available data on the books are limited as per what was provided by Udacity.

## Installation and Start

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Contributing

This repository is the completed project by me, based on a starter code provided for _all_ Udacity students.
